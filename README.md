*Cosmonaut*

Built as a client-side demonstration of simple procedural generation, now updated to use Socket.io to generate the world on the server side and serve it to a number of clients, who can then fly around and wave at each other.

*Running*
```
npm install
node index.js
Go to http://localhost:3000/
